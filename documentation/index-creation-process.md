This document explains the steps followed to create an index from the nips dataset using the sqlite database file downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/nips-papers

# Check the content of the papers table

# Clean the abstract and the text for all papers

## Proposed cleaning process

## Cleaning process for the abstracts

## Cleaning process for the text
