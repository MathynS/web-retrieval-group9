A Systematic Study or the Input/Output Properties

A Systematic Study of the Input/Output Properties
of a 2 Compartment Model Neuron
With Active Membranes

Paul Rhodes
University of California, San Diego

ABSTRACT
The input/output properties of a 2 compartment model neuron are systematically
explored. Taken from the work of MacGregor (MacGregor, 1987), the model neuron
compartments contain several active conductances, including a potassium conductance in
the dendritic compartment driven by the accumulation of intradendritic calcium.
Dynamics of the conductances and potentials are governed by a set of coupled first order
differential equations which are integrated numerically. There are a set of 17 internal
parameters to this model, specificying conductance rate constants, time constants,
thresholds, etc.
To study parameter sensitivity, a set of trials were run in which the input driving the
neuron is kept fixed while each internal parameter is varied with all others left fixed.
To study the input/output relation, the input to the dendrite (a square wave) was varied
(in frequency and magnitude) while all internal parameters of the system were left flXed,
and the resulting output firing rate and bursting rate was counted.
The input/output relation of the model neuron studied turns out to be much more
sensitive to modulation of certain dendritic potassium current parameters than to
plasticity of synapse efficacy per se (the amount of current influx due to synapse
activation). This would in turn suggest, as has been recently observed experimentally,
that the potassium current may be as or more important a focus of neural plasticity than
synaptic efficacy.

INTRODUCTION
In order to model biologically realistic neural systems, we will ultimately be seeking to
construct networks with thousands of neurons and millions of interconnections. It is
therefor desireable to employ basic units with sufficient computational simplicity to
make meaningful simulations tractable, yet with sufficient fidelity to biological neurons
that we may retain a hope of gleaning by these simulations something about the activity
going on during biological information processing.

The types of neuron models employed in the computational neuroscience literature range
from binary threshold units to sigmoid transfer functions to 1500 compartment neurons
with Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics for a whole set of active conductances and spines with
rich internal structure. In principle, a model neuron's functional participation in the
operation of a network may be fully characterized by a complete description of its
transfer function, or input-output relation. This relation would necessarily be
parameterized by a host of internal variables (which would include conductance rate
constants and parameters defining the neuron's morphology) as well as a very rich space
characterizing possible variations in input (including location of input in dentritic tree).
In learning to judge which structural elements of highly realistic models must be
preserved and which may be simplified, one approach will be to test the degree to which
the input-output relation of the simplified neuron (given a physiologically relevant
parameter range and input space) is sufficiently close to the input-output properties of
the highly realistic model.
To define 'sufficiently close', we will ultimately refer to the operation of the network as
a whole as follows: the transfer function of a simplified neuron model will be considered
'sufficiently close' to a more realistic neuron model if a chosen information processing
task carried out by the overall network is performed by a network built up of the
simplified neurons in a manner close to that observed in a network of the more realistic
neurons.
We propose to begin by exploring the input/output properties of a greatly simplified 2
compartment model neuron with active conductances. Even in this very simple structure
there are many (17) internal parameters for things like time constants and activation rates
of currents. We wish to understand the parameter sensitivity of this model system and
characterize its input-output relation.

1.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL NEURON
THE MODEL NEURON CONSISTS OF A SOMA WITH A VOLTAGE-GATED
POTASSIUM CONDUCTANCE AND A SINGLE COMPARTMENT DENDRITE
WITH A VOLTAGE-GATED CALCIUM CONDUCTANCE AND A [CAl-GATED
POTASSIUM CONDUCTANCE
We will choose for this study a simple model neuron described by MacGregor (I987). It
possesses a single compartment dendrite. This is viewed as a crude approximation to the
lumped reduction of a dendritic tree. In this approximation, we are neglecting spatial and
temporal summing of individual synaptic EPSP's distributed over a dendritic tree, as well
as the spatial and temporal dispersion (smearing) due to transmission to the soma. The
individual inputs we will be using are large enough to drive the soma to firing, and so
would represent the summation of many relatively simultaneous individual EPSPs,
perhaps as from the set of contacts upon a neuron's dendritic tree made by the
arborization of one different axon. The dendritic membrane possesses a potassium
conductance gated by intradendritic calcium concentration and a voltage gated calcium
conductance. The soma contains its own voltage-gated potassium channels and
membrane time constants. Electrical connection between soma and dendrite is expressed
by an input impedance in each direction. The soma fires an action potential, simply
expressed by raising its voltage to 50 mv for one msec after its internal voltage has been

A Systematic Study or the Input/Output Properties

driven to firing threshold. Calcium accumulation in the dendrite is modelled assuming
accumulation proportional to calcium conductance. Calcium conductance itself increases
in proportion to the difference between the dendrite's voltage and a threshold, and calcium
is removed from the dendrite by means of an exponential decay. This system is modelled
by a set of coupled frrst order differential equations as follows:

1.1 THE SET OF EQUATIONS
VARIABLES OF THIS MODEL

GOVERNING THE

DYNAMIC

The soma's voltage ES is governed by:

dES/dt={ -ES+SOMAINPUT +GDS *(ED-ES)+GKS *(EK-ES)} IfS
where SOMAINPUT is obtained by dividing the input current by the total resting
conductance of the dendrite (therefor it has units of voltage). GDS is proportional to
input resistance from dendrite to soma, and multiplies the difference between the
dendrite's voltage ED and the soma's voltage ES; GKS is the soma's aggregate
potassium conductance (modelled below); EK is the voltage of the potassium battery
(assumed constant at -1 Omv); and TS is the soma's time constant. All potentials are
relative to resting potential, and all conductances are dimensionless.
The dendrite's voltage ED is govened by:
dED/dt={-ED+DENDINPUT+GSD*(ES-ED)+GCA*(ECA-ED)+ GKD*(EK-ED)}IID
where DENDINPUT is obtained by dividing the input current by the total resting
conductance of the dendrite and so has units of voltage. GSD is proportional to the
input resistance from soma to dendrite, and hence multiplies the difference between ES
and ED; GCA is the dendrite's calcium conductance (modelled below), ECA is the
calcium battery (assumed constant at 50mv), and GKD is proportional to the dendrite's
potassium conductance (modelled below). All potentials are relative to resting potential.
The soma's voltage is raised artificially to 50mv for I msec after the soma's voltage
exceeds a (fixed) threshold, thus simplifying the action potential.
The potassium conductance in the soma, GKS, is governed by:
dGKS/dt={ -GKS+S*B}lfGK
where S is 1 if an action potential has just fired and 0 otherwise, B is an activation rate
constant governing the rate of increase of potassium conductance, and TGK is the time
constant of the potassium conductance decay. This rather simplified picture of
potassium conductance will be replaced by a more realistic version with a Markov state
model of the potassium channel in a subsequent publication in preparation. For the
present investigation then we are modelling the voltage dependence of the potassium
conductance by the following: potassium conductance builds up by a fixed amount
(proportional to BlfGK) during each action potential, and thereafter decays exponentially
with time constant TGK.

The dendrite's calcium conductance is governed by:

dGCNdt={ -GCA +D*(ED-CSPlKETHRESH)} IfGCA
dGCNdt={ -GCNlGCA}

ED>CSPIKETHRESH
ED<CSPlKETHRESH

where CSPIKETHRESH is the minimum dendritic voltage above which calcium
conducting channels begin to be opened, D is an activation rate governing the rate of
increase in calcium conductance, and TGCA is the time constant assumed to govern
conductance decay when voltage is below threshold
The dendrite's internal calcium concentration [CA] is governed by:
d[ CAYdt={ -[ CA]+A *GCA}IfCA
where TCA is the time constant for the removal of internal CA, and A is a parameter
governing the accumulation rate of increase of internal CA for a given conductance and
time constant. A is inversely proportional to the effective relevant volume in which
calcium is accumulating. An increase in internal calcium buffer would decrease the
parameter A.
Finally, the dendrite's potassium conductance is governed by:
dGKD/dt={ -GKD+ BD} /TGKD
dGKDldt={ -GKD} IfGKD

[CA]>CALCTHRESH
[CA]<CALCTHRESH

where CALCTHRESH is the internal calcium concentration threshold above which the
calcium gated potassium channel begins to open, BD is the parameter governing the rate
of increase of dendritic potassium conductance, and TGKD is the time constant
governing the exponential decay of potassium conductance.
This entire system of equations is taken from the work of MacGregor
(MacGregor, 1987).

The system of coupled fIrst order differential equations is integrated using the exponential
method, also discussed in MacGregor. Generally a 1 msec timestep is used, with a
smaller timestep of .1 msec used for the relaxation between the dendritic voltage ED and
the somatic voltage ES.

2.0 THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN PARAMETERS (TIME
CONSTANTS, CONDUCTANCE RATES, ETC.) ON THE
MODEL NEURON'S INPUT-OUTPUT PROPERTIES WILL
BE EXPLORED
As is clear from a review of the above set of interrelated equations governing the
dynamics of the state variables of the model neuron, there are quite a few externally
specified parameters (I7) even in such a simple model. Presumably the thresholds are
fairly well measureable, and the rate constants and time constants may be specified by
measurement of time courses in patch clamp experiments. We are nevertheless dealing
with parameters of which some are thought to be variable and which are probably

A Systematic Study or the Input/Output Properties
modulated explicitly by normal mechanisms in neurons. Therefor we wish to explore
the effect that variation of any of these parameters has on the input-output properties of
the model neuron. In fact, we will find indication that the modulation of
these parameters, in particular the rate constants governing the
dendritic potassium current and internal calcium accumulation, may be
very effective targets of neural plasticity. We find that the neuron's
input-output properties are more sensitive to these parameters than to
modulation of the efficacy of the synapse strength per see

2.1 PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATION OF THE
EFFECT OF VARIATION IN THE MODEL'S PARAMETERS ON THE
INPUT-OUTPUT PROPERTIES OF THE MODEL NEURON
We started with the parameters all set to a set of benchmarks and drove the neuron with a
constant input to the dendrite. (We could have driven the soma instead, or both soma
and dendrite, and we could have chosen more complex input streams. See below for
trials where we systematically vary the input but the parameter values are held steady.)
The input was a steady command input of 35mv. The values of all the benchmark
parameters are given in Table 1.
We then systematically halved and doubled each of the 17 parameters in turn, while
leaving all other parameters fixed. Note that in all cases and in fact with any driving
input this model neuron fires in bursts. This is due to the long time course of the
potassium current in the dendrite, which enforces a long refractory period (about 4080msec) even during continuous stimulation.

2.2 RESULTS OF SYSTEMATIC VARIATION OF PARAMETERS
OF MODEL NEURON
The results are summarized in the notes to Table 1. Following are several
observations about the different parameters' varying degree of efficacy in modulation of
the input-output function.
1) The most striking finding is that variation of the activation rate of the potassium
current, particularly the potassium current in the dendrite, is the most effective means of
modulating the input-output properties of the model neuron. The transfer function is
250% more sensitive to an increase in the [CA]-gated dendritic potassium current
activation rate than it is to an increase in synaptic efficacy ~~.
2) Changing the time constant of the [CA]-gated potassium current in the dendrite is
the only parameter change which effectively modulates the number of bursts per
second (see Figure I). Changing the time constant of the voltage-gated potassium
current in the soma, does not have any effect on the number of bursts per second.

3.0 MEASUREMENT OF THE INPUT/OUTPUT RELATION
OF THE MODEL NEURON
The input/output relation was detennined by the following protocol: The input was
supplied in the fonn of a square wave of current injected into the dendritic compartment,
and the frequency of the pulses and their magnitude was systematically varied.
The output of the soma, in the form of action potentials fIred per second, was plotted
against the input rate, defined as the product of the square wave frequency and the
magnitude of the injected current. The duration of pulses was kept fixed at 20 msec (but
see below), all internal parameters were fIXed at their benchmark levels.
3.1

THE SHAPE OF THE INPUT/OUTPUT RELATION

Figure 2 depicts the above described plot in the case where all the internal parameters
were fixed at purported "benchmark" values except for the parameters governing
intradendritic calcium accumulation.. It is clearly not strictly monotonic (there are
resonance points) though a smoothed version is monotonic, and it does not faithfully
render a sigmoid.
3.2 THE INPUT/OUTPUT RELATION IS UNCHANGED IF THE
SQUARE SHAPE OF THE EPSP DRIVING THE DENDRITE IS
REPLACED BY AN ALPHA FUNCTION
The trials in this study were largely conducted using a square wave as the input driving
the dendritic compartment. In order to check whether the unphysical square shape of the
envelope of this current injection was coloring the results, the input/output relation was
measured in a set of trials wherein the alpha function commonly used to model the time
course of EPSP's replaced the square pulse. The total current injected per pulse was kept
uniform. The results, shown in
Figure 3, are surprising:
The
input/output relation was almost completely unaltered by the
substitution.
This suggests that the detailed shape and fourier
spectrum of the time course of synaptic input has nearly no effect of
the neuron's output. Thus it is suggested that very adequate models can be built
without the need for a strict modelling of the synaptic EPSP. I expect this effect is due
to the temporal integration ongoing in the summation of input to this system, which
blurs the exact shape of any input envelope.
3.3 MODULATION OF THE INPUT/OUTPUT RELATION
VARIATION OF INTERNAL MODEL PARAMTERS

BY

Figure 1 portrays the input/output relation measured in three cases in which all internal
parameters are identical except the rate of accumulation of intradendric calcium. The
lower curve is the case where the calcium accumulation rate is highest. Since [Ca]
accumulation drives the dendritic potassium current, the activation of which in tum
hyperpolarizes the dendrite and thus indirectly suppresses firing in the soma, we expect
output in this case to be lower for a given input as is indeed the result observed. Note
that the parameter being varied would be expected to be inversely proportional to the
amount of available intradendritic calcium buffer. Hence the amount of

A Systematic Study or the Input/Output Properties

intradendritic buffer has a profound ability to modulate the transfer
function of the system.

4.0 CONCLUSIONS
As regards the shape of the transfer function itself, we have found it to be nonmonotonic (there are resonance points) unless it is smoothed. The shape of the transfer
function appears little effected by the envelope of the EPSP (Le. square pulse input
produces nearly the same transfer function as the case where alpha functions are
substituted for the square pulses in modelling the EPSP).
A parameter sensitivity analysis of a 2 compartment model neuron with active
membranes reveals some unexpected results. For example, the input/output (transfer)
function of the neuron is 250% more sensitive to the activation rate of the [CA]-gated
dendritic potassium current than it is to synaptic efficacy per se. This in turn suggests
that, as has indeed been observed (Alkon et~ 1988; Hawkins, 1989; Olds etal, 1989),
nature might employ mechanisms other than simply increasing synaptic conductance
during the EPSP to enhance the efficacy of the transfer function.

A Systematic Study or the Input/Output Properties

NOTES TO PARAMETER SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
(1) The number of spikes per burst is altered by modulating the internal calcium
concentration required to trigger the dendritic potassium current. In an observation
repeated several times herein, it seems clear that modulating the hyperpolarizing
potassium current has a marked effectiveness in modulating the neuron's output.
(2) Modulating the activation rate (B) of the somatic potassium current strongly effects
ruing, but changing the time constant of this current has almost no effect either on
bursts/second or spikeslburst.
(3) However, note that, among all 17 parameters of this model neuron, it is only the
time constant of the [CAl-gated dendritic potassium current which is effective in
modulating the rate of bursting (whereas th e somatic potassium current time constant
does not seem to effect the model neuron's output at alI).
(4) This quantity, the accumulation rate of calcium in the dendrite per unit calcium
conductance, would increase as the effectiveness of calcium buffers within the dendrite
decreased.
(5) Despite its efficacy in modulating the neuron's output, this parameter is presumably
not a likely candidate for plasticity, because it depends on the axial resistance of the
cytoplasm, the cross section of the base of the dendrite, and the volume of the soma, all
of which seem unlikely to be the subject to modulation.
(6) Surprisingly, the overall input-output relation for the neuron is not much effected by
changing the threshold for the voltage gated calcium spike activity in the dendrite.
(7) The minimum dendritic input required to produce any spike activity (that is, to
increase the voltage in the soma above firing threshold) may be calculated to be 26.4
with all the other parameters at benchmark values. Hence 27 is an input level that is
only 2% above the minimum level to get any firing at all. Note that it appears a 2
spike burst is always produced (with the internal parameters set at the benchmark levels)
if any firing at all is elicited. The number of spikes per burst, then, is modulated by
conductance activation rates and calcium accumulation rates but not by input. Tables 2
and 3 demonstrate this over a wide range of inputs.
(8) Note that doubling the synaptic input to the dendrite only increases the model
neuron's firing rate by 25.4%, but that, for example, doubling the activiation rate of the
dendritic calcium current increases the firing rate by 64.4%. Hence we suggest that
modulation of synaptic efficacy is not the only choice or even the most effective choice
for the mechanism underlying plasticity. Alkon (1988,1989) and others have in fact
recently reported that an increase in protein kinase C, leading to a reduction in calciumactivated potassium current, is observed to be associated with conditioning in
Hermissenda and rabbit. Thus, plasticity in the nervous system may indeed operate via a
whole set of internal dynamic parameters, of which synapse efficacy is only one.
