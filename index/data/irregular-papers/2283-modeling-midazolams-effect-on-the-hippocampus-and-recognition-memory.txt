1 Introduction
'Danlage to the hippocampus (and nearby regions), often caused by lesiclns
leaves normal cognitive function intact in the short term., including long".tenn
memo-ry retrieval, but prevents learning of new1' inJornlat.ion.We have found a ,yay
to begin to distinguish two alternative accounts for this lea.ming deficit: Does
damage cause less storage, or less accurate storagc 1 of information in long-term
episodic menlQry?! We addressed this question by using the REM model of
recognition 'mC'mQry [18] to fit data collected by Hirshnlan and colleagues [9], vlho

tested recognition memory in nornlalparticipants given either saline (control group)
or Midazolam, a benzodiazepine that temporarily- causes anterograde amnesia with
effects that generally' 'mimic those found after hippoca.mpa1 dan1age.

Empirical findings

The participants in Hirshman et at [9] studied lists of \~ords that ?varied in
nomlative. word frequency (Le., lo\v-frequency vs. high.-frequency) and the amount of
time allocated for study (either not studied, or studied for 500, 1.200, or 2500 ms per
?word)+ These variables are known to have a robust effect on rec.ognition memory in
nornlal populations; Lo\v-frequency (LF) \vords are better recognized tllan high??
frequency (FIT) \"rOrd5~ an.d a.n. increase in study tinle inJproves recognition perfbl1:11ance.
In. addi.tion~ the probability ofrespon.ding 'oldY to studied words (temJed hit rate~ or FfR) is
higher forL?F \:vords than forHF '\?ords, and t11e probability of responding 'old? to
unstu.died. \\lords (~ermed fa.tse alarm. rate, or FAR) is lo\>ver for l,F \vords than. tor HF
'\Tords. Th.is pattern of data is commonly kno\vn as a ~l;mirror etIecf' [7].,
In. Hirshulan et al. [9], participants received either salin.e or l'vfidazolatn a11d

graphically. The R.EM 1110del of the \~lord-frequency effect described by Shiffrin and
Steyvers [13, 18, 19] is a member of this class of models, as \ve describe next.

RE.M [1.8] assumes that memory traces consist of vectors Y, of length ~, of
nonnegativ?e integer feature values Zero represents no infomlation about a feature
()thenvise the values for a given feature? are assum.ed to tbllo\\l the geometric. probability
distribution given as Equation 1: P(V = j) = (l_gy-lg, for j= 1 and higber~ Thus higber
integer values represent feature values less likely to be encountered in the environment
R.EM adopts a "feature-frequen.cy'" assumption [13]: the lexicalJsemantic traces of lU\\ler
frequency ?words are generated \vith a low?er value of g (Le. gLP < gllr). These
lexical/semantic traces represent general knovvledge (ekg~, the orthographic, pl1onological,
senlantic, and contextual characteristics of a \vord) and bave very many non-zero feature
values~ most of'\vl1icb. are e.ncoded correctly. Episodic traces represent the occurrence of
stinluli in a certain environmental context; they are built of tlle same feature types as
lexical/senlantic traces, but tend to be in,cOlnplete (bavemany zero values) and inaccurate
(the values do not nec.essarily represent correctly the ?v?alues ofth,e presented event).
+

v

When a \vord is studied, an incomplete and error prone representation of the
trace is stored in a. separate episodic image. The probability
that a feature ',eVill be stored in the episodic inlage after! time units of study is given
as Equation 2: 1 - (1 - 11*)1, where !!* is the probability of storing a feature in an
arbitrary un-it of time~ The number of attempts, 1j, at storin.g a con.tent featur-e for an
itenl studied for j units of time is co.mputed from Equation 3: 11 == 11.=.1(1 +' ~-JAJ), \vh.-ere

At test, a probe made with context features only is assumed to activate the
episodic traces~ Ij, of the !l list i tenlS and no otllefS [24]. Then the content features of the
probe cue are tnatched in parallel to the activated traces..For each episodic trace, Ii, the
system notes the values. of features of Ii that rnatch the corresponding feature of the cue
(njjm stands for the number of matching values in tl1e j-th image that have value i)} and the
ntnnber of nlisulatcbing featq.res (njq stands tor the number of mismatching values in the
fhimage). Next~ a likelihood ratio, ~j~ is cOlnputed for each Ii:

~ is the likelihood ratio for the fh itnage~ It can be thought of as a? runtchstrength bet\veen the retrieval cue and.Ii. It gives tlle probability of the data (the olutcl1es
and misn1atches) given that tlle retrieval cue and the inlage represent the san1e word (in
which case features are expected to luatch, except for errors in storage) divided by the
probability' of the data given t11at the retrieval cue and tIle irnage represent different "fords
(in \vhich case features matell only by chance).

TI,e recognition decision is based on the odds1 <1>, giving the probability that the
test item is old divided by the probability the test itetn is ne," [18]. This is just the
average of the likelihood ratios:

If the odds exceed a criterion~ then an Uoldj~ response is 1nade, The default criterion is '1.0
(wllich maximizes probability correct) although subjects could of course deviate from
this setting.
Thus an Hold" response is given 'Vvnen there is more evidence that the test ,vord
is old. !\1atching features contribute evidence that an item is old (contribute factors to the
product in ,Eq. 3 greater than 1~O) and n1ismatching features contribute evidence that an
item is ne\\' (contribute factors less than l .O)~ RE!vlpredicts an effect of study time
because storage of Olore non-zero features increases the number of matching target-trace
features; this factor outweighs the general increase in variance produced by'" greater
nunlbers of non-zero features in
vectors. 'RENt predicts a L?F HR advantage because
the matching ofthe more uncon1mon features associated 'W'"ith LF words produces greater
evidence that the item is old than the matching of the more COOlmon features associated
with H.F words..For foils~ however~ every teature match is due to chance; such matching
occurs n10re frequently for HF tl1an LF \vords because HF features are ,nore common
[12]. TIlis factor outweighs the higher diagnosticity of matches tl1f theLF words, andHF
vV'otds are predicted to have higher FARs than L?F '\vords~

an

Much evidence points to the critical role of the hippocampal region in
storing episodic memory' traces ['I, 14, l5, ] 6 20]. Interestingly, f\.1idazolam has
been sho\vn to affect the storage, but not the retrieval of memory traces [22]. As
described above, there are tw'o parameters in R.EM that affect the storage offeatures
in tnemory: 11* detennines the nuolber of features that get stored, ~nd ?. deternlines
the accuracy with which features get stored. In order to lower performance, it could
be assun1ed that Midazolanl reduces the values of eitl1er or both oftl1eseparameters.
Ho\vever, Hirshulan et at '8 data constrain wl11ch of these possibil ities is viable.
l

Let us assutne that MidazoJam only causes the hippocampal region to store
fe\ver features, relative to the saline condition (i.e. ll* is reduced). In REM~ this

causes te\\>Ter terms in the product given by .Eq. 4~ and a lO\\>Tervalue for tlle result~
on the average. Het1ce~ if Midazolam causes fe\ver features to be stored~ subjects
should approach chance-le,\tel performance for both HF and .LF \-'lords: LF{FA.R) ~
H.F(F..A.R) . ..,/ L-F(HR) . . ~ HF(HR). However, Hirshnlan et a1 found that the difference
in the LF and H'F FA.Rs \?as not affected b:y 1\1idazolam. In RETvl this difference
would n.ot be much affected; if at al1~ 'by changes in criterion, or c.hanges in & that
one 1111ght assume Midazolam induces. Thus \vithin the fratnework of R.ENf, the
main effect of l\1idazolam on the functioning of the hippocampal region is not to
reduce the n.umber of features "that get stored.

Alternatively let us assunle that Midazolam causes tIle hippocalTIpal region
to store '~nQisier" episodic traces, as o.pposed to traces wi th feV~ter :non-zero features~
instantiated in RE?Tvf by d.ecreasing the valu.e of th.e ~ parameter (that governs coo-ect
copying of a feature value). Decreasing Q only slightly affects the false alann rates~
because these FARs are based on chance matches 1 .HO\\feVer, decreasing ~ causes
the LF an.d .HF old-itenl distributions (see Figure 3) to ~pproacb. the L~F and HF ne\\L..
item distrihutions; \vhen. the decrease is large en.oug:h.~ this factor tnust cause the LF
and .HF old-item distributions to reverse position. The reversal occ.urs bee-ause the
H,F retrieval cues used to prope melTIOry have more comnlon features (on average)
than the LF retrieval cues, a factor that cornes to dominate \vhen the true 'signar
(mate-hing features in the target trace) begins to disintegrate into noise (due to
l.o\vering of~).

Figure 1. shows predictions of a REM nlodel incorporating the? assumption
that only ~ \taries benveen the saline a.nd IVIidazolalTI groups~ a.nd only at storage,
.For retrieval the same ~ value \vas used iri both the saline and Midazolanl conditions
to calculate the likelihoods in E,q~ation 4 (an assumptioll consistent with retrieval
tuned to the partiei.pant's lifetime learning, and consistent ,vith prior findings
sh{)~ring that Midazolam affec.ts the storage of traces and not their retrieval [17].
The criterion for an. oldlnc\v judgment '--va.s set to ;,92~ rather than. tlle nornlatively
optimal value of I ~O!lin order to obtain a good qua.ntitative fit, but the criterion did
not vary betw~een. the 1v1idazolarn and saline gro~ps, and therefore is 110t of
consequence tor the present article \Vithin the RE,M framework; then; the main
effect of Midazolan1 is to ca?use the hippocampal region to store more noisy episodic
traces. These conclusions are based on the recognition data. 'h7 e tum next to the
remenlber/kno\v judgments.
x

\Ve chose to model renlenlber.. kno\v judgments in "vhat is probably the
shnplest way. The approach is based on the olodels described by Donaldson [41 and
.Hirsbrnan and Master [10, II]. As described above~ an totd t decision is given when
the familiarity (Le~ a,ctivation~ or in RE1vf tenns the odds) a.ssociated '\vith a test
'word exceeds tb.e yes-no criterion. \\7Jlen this happens, th.en. it is aSSUllled th.at a

renlenlherllo,O\v" criterion a.re given the ?'renlenlber" response, and a "knowH
response is givenw'hen the remember/kno\? criterion is 110t exceeded. Figure 2
shows that this lnodel predicts the effects of MidazQlam and saline both
qualitatively and qua,ntitatively?. TIllS fit was obtained by' using slightly different
renlenlber~know criteria in the saline and 'Midazolam conditions (1.40 and 1.26 in
the saline and Midazolam conditions, respectively), but aJl the qualitative effects are
predicted correctly even\vhen the same criterion is adopted for remembetlknow.

These predictions pro'lide a.n existence proof that Hirshman et aL [9] were a bit
hasty in. usin.g tlleir data to reject single.. process tnodels of the present type [4, 11]:t
an.d sho\v that single- versus dual-process models \\lQuld hav?e to be distinguished on
the basis of other sorts of studies. There is already a large literature devoted to this
as-yet-unresolved issue [10], and spa.ce prevents discussion here.
Thus far we detnonstrated tlle sufticien.cy of a model assulning that
lVHdazolanl reduc.es storage acc?uracy rathe-r than storage quantity, an.d have argued
that the reverse assumption cannot 'Vvork. \Vhat degree of Inixture of tllese

LF-Fi\R. advantage that deviated from the data by bein.g noticeably snlaller in. the
Midazolanl than saline condition. Within. the RE.1\1 fratnework this result suggests
the maill effect of l\1idazolalu (possibly all tIle effect) is on ~ (accuracy of storage)
rather than Otll1* (quantity of storage).

4 Neurosc.ientific. Speculations

The }lippocatnpus (proper) consists of approximately 'I O~/~ C] ABAergic
intern.euron.s, and these intern.eurons are th.ought to control tbe firing of the
remaining 909/~ of the hippocan1pal principle neurons [21]. Some of the principle
neur011S are gra.nule neurons and SOlne are pyramidal neurons~ The granule cells are
associated ,vitb. a rhythmic pattern of neuronal activity k~llown as theta,,vaves [1]~
Tl1eta \\laves are associated ",tith exploratory activities in both animals [1.6] and
hUlnans [2]~ activities in \vhic.h infortnation about novel situations is being acquired.
Midazolam is a. benzodiazepine~ and benzodiazepines inhibit the tiring of
(]ABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus [3]. Hence, if tv1idazolan) inhibits the
tiring of those cells that regulate the orderly firing of the vac;t majority of
hippocampal cel1s!l then it is a reasonable to speculate that the result is a "noisier"
episodic memory trace~
The a.rgUlnent that?vt idazolaln causes noisier storage rather than less
storage raises tb.e question whether a sitnilar process produces th.e silnilar effects
caused by hippocampal lesions or other sorts of datnage (e.g.. Korsakoff's
syndrolne). l'hi8 question could be explored in future research.
