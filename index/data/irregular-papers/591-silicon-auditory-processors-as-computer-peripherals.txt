1. INTRODUCTION
Several researchers have implemented comput.at.ional models of biological audit.ory
processing, with the goal of incorporat.ing t.hese models into a speech recognition
system (for a recent review, see (Jankowski, 1992)). These projects have shown the
promise of the biological approach, someti Illes showing clear performance advantages over traditiona.l methods.
The application of t.IH'se comput.('tional models is limited by t.heir large computation and communication I?eqllil?ement.::.;. A lIalog VLSI implementations of these
neural models may relieve t.his cOlllput.at.ional burden; several VLSI research groups
have effort.s in this area, and working int.egrated circuit models of nlany popular
representat.ions present.ly exist.. A review of t.h('se models is present.ed in (Lazzaro,
1991). In this paper, we present. an interface met.hod (Ma.howald, 1992; Sivilott.i,
1991) that addresses the cOll1l1lllnicHt.ions issues between analog VLSI auditory implementations and digital processors.

2. COMMUNICATIONS IN NEURAL SYSTEMS
Biological neurons COlli IllU lIicat.e 10llg dist.anc('s using a pulse represent.ation. Communications engineers have developed several schemes for communicat.ing on a wire
using pulses as aLomic unit.s. In t.hese schemes, maximally using the communications bandwidth of a wire implies t.lw nlPan rat.e of pulses on t.he wire is a significant
fract.ion of the maxil1lum pulse I'at.e allowed 011 the wire.
Using this criterion, nemal syst.el\1s lise wir('s very illefficiently. Tn most. parts of the

3. THE EVENT-ADDRESS PROTOCOL
The unique characteristics of enel?gy-efficient. codes define the remaining off-chip
communications problem. In the spiking nemon protocol, the height. and width of
the spike carries no informat.ion; the neuron imparts new information only at the
moment a spike begins. This moment occurs asynchronously; there is no global clock
synchronizing the output units. One way of completely specifying the information
in the output units is an event list., a tabulation of the precise time each output
unit. begins a new spike. vVe can use this specification as a basis for an off-chip
communicat.ions system, t.hat. sends an event.-list message off-chip at the moment. an
output neuron begins a new spike. An eVl'nt.-list message includes the identificat.ion
of the output unit., and the t.ime of firing . A pcrformance analysis of' this protocol
can be found in (Lazzal'O et al., l!J92).
Note that an explicit timest.amp for each clIt.l?y in t.he cvent list is not necessary, if
communication lat.ency betwcen t.he scnding chip and the receiver is a constant. In
this case, the sender simply com1l1I1nicRt,es, lIpon onset of a. spike from an output, the
identit.y of the output. unit.; t.he l'eceivcl' can aPPclld a locally genera.ted timestamp
to complete the event. If simplificd in t.his mallllcr, we refcl' to the event-list protocol
as the event.-a.ddress protocol.
''''e have designed a \vol'king syst.em t.hat. comput.es a model of auditory nerve response, in rea] t.ime, usillg ana.log V LSI processing. This syst.em takes as input

4. SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION
Figure 1 is a block diagl'am of this system. A single VLSI chip computes the auditory
model response; an array of spiking neuron circuit.s is the final representation of the
model. This chip also implements t.he event-address protocol, using asynchronous
arbitration circuits. The chip produces a pa.rallel binary encoding of the model
output, as an asynchronous stream of event addt?esses. These on-chip operations
are shown inside the dashed recta.ngle in Figure 1, labelled Chip Architecture.
Additional digital processing com~letes t.he custom hardwa.re in the system. This
hardware transforms the event.-address prot.ocol int.o an event-list. protocol, by
adding a time marker for each event (16 bit time markers with 20ps resolution).
In addition, the hardware implemellt.s the bus interface to the host computer, in
conjunction with a commercial int.erface board. The commercial interface board
supports 10 MBytes/second asynchronous da.ta tl'ansfers between our custom hardware and the host computer, and includes 8 KByt.es of data buffers. Our display
software produces a real-time graphical display of the audit.ory model response,
using the X window syst.em .

5. VLSI CIRCUIT DETAILS
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of t.he chip. The analog input signal connects
to circuits t.hat. perform analog pl'Ocessing, t hat are fully described and referenced
in (Lazzal'O et al., 1993). The outpllt. of this analog processing is represented by
150 spiking neurons, arranged in a ~O by 5 array. These are the output units of
the chip; the event.-address prot.ocol commllnicates t.he a.ctivity of these units off
chip. At the onset of a spike from an output unit, t.he array position of the spiking
unit, encoded as a binary number, appears on the output bus. The asynchronous
out.put bus is shown in FigurE' 2 as t.he dat.a signals marked Encoded X Output
(column position) and Encoded Y Output (row position), and the acknowledge
and request control signals Ae and Re.
"Ve implemented the event.-address pl'Ot.ocol as an asynchl'Onous arbitration prot.ocol
in two dimensions. ]ll t.his scheme, an out.put. unit. can access two request. lines,
one a.<;socia.ted wit.h its row and one ;.)ssociat.ed with its column. Using a wire-OR
signalling prot.ocol. any out.put. unit 011 a part.icular row or colllmn may assert the
request line. Each request. lillE' is paired wit.h an acknowledge line, driven by the
arbitration circuitt?y out.sidr. t.h0 array. Rowand column wires for acknowledge and
request are explicit.ly showl! in Figll\'e 2. as t he lines that form a grid inside the
output. unit. array.
At the onset of a. spike, an out.put. unit. a~sert . s it.s row request. line, and wait.s for
a reply on it.s \'Ow acknowlf>dge line. An aSYllchronous arbit.rat.ion syst.em, mar'ked
in Figure 2 as Y Arhitration Tree. aSSl\res only one out.put row is acknowledged.
Aft.er row acknowledgement., the output unit. assel't.s its column request line, and
waits for a reply on it.s COlU11111 acknowledge line. The al?bit.ration system is shown
in detail in Figure 2: fOllr two-input. arhit.f'r circuit.s, shown a.<; rectangles marked
with the letter A, arc connect.ed as a t.ree t.o arhit.rat.e among t.he 5 column inputs.

Upon the an'ival of hot.h row and column acknowledgement.s, t.he output unit releases both row and column request. lines. St.a.t.ic lat.ches, shown in Figure 2 as the
rectangles marked Control Logic:, ret.ain t.he stat.e of the row and column request
lines.
Binary encoders transfonl1 t.he row and column acknowledge lines int.o the output
data bus. Another column encoder Sf'nses t.he acknowledgement of any column, and
asserts the bus cont.rol OUt.PIlt. R e. \," hell t.he ('xtcl'ncd device has secmed t.he data,
it responds by a.'3sert.ing t.he Ae signal. The At: signal clears the st.at.ic latches in

complet.e, and the chip is reacly for t.he next communication event.
